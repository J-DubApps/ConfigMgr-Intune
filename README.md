# Description

This repo contains Configuration Manager and Intune Tools, Resources, and scripts that I use or wrote.  Wherever I am using code sourced from elsewhere on Github etc, attribution is provided whenever I have it.

# ConfigMgr-Intune

The OSD-Appx-Removals Folder contains my own "hit list" of annoyance / non work-related apps (xbox apps, Bing etc) and apps that are not stored in conventional methods for UE-V (Windows Sticky Notes, etc) and are therefore a DLP risk.
