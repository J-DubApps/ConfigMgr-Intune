Built-in apps listed below are, in my findings, should remain as they will generate User and Service Desk Requests to restore (ScreenSketch, Todos, etc), have business use-case, or are
useful in managing Windows 10/11.  Some of the versions given may be different than your own Endpoint, so it is best to take inventory of your own system and compare to the list below.

Note: A lot of these framework/infra Appx may seem risky to leave on an Endpoint if your environment doesn't use them; however, the ones I list can have be disabled/managed through CM/GPO/Intune.
For example, I advise leaving Biometric & auth Appx entries, as well as .NET and UI related apps.  You WILL run into future problems if you go removing them.

Re: Microsoft.OneDriveSync - I advise only removing this when you are absolutely certain OneDrive will never be used during your Endpoints' lifecycles.  Better to disable OneDrive via
the Registry as well as hide it from Explorer, and leave Microsoft.OneDriveSync for future use.  I have yet to see any private non-Govt org that stays away from OneDrive forever (or on all Endpoints)
so I leave it available and hide it instead.
